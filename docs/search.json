      "contents": "\r\nR-squared is a statistic that often accompanies regression output. It ranges in value from 0 to 1 and is usually interpreted as summarizing the percent of variation in the response that the regression model explains. So an R-squared of 0.65 might mean that the model explains about 65% of the variation in our dependent variable. Given this logic, we prefer our regression models have a high R-squared.\r\nIn R, we typically get R-squared by calling the summary function on a model object. Here’s a quick example using simulated data:\r\n\r\n\r\n# independent variable\r\nx <- 1:20 \r\n# for reproducibility\r\nset.seed(1) \r\n# dependent variable; function of x with random error\r\ny <- 2 + 0.5*x + rnorm(20,0,3) \r\n# simple linear regression\r\nmod <- lm(y~x)\r\n# request just the r-squared value\r\nsummary(mod)$r.squared          \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6026682\r\n\r\nOne way to express R-squared is as the sum of squared fitted-value deviations divided by the sum of squared original-value deviations:\r\n\\[\r\nR^{2} =  \\frac{\\sum (\\hat{y} – \\bar{\\hat{y}})^{2}}{\\sum (y – \\bar{y})^{2}}\r\n\\]\r\nWe can calculate it directly using our model object like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n# extract fitted (or predicted) values from model\r\nf <- mod$fitted.values\r\n# sum of squared fitted-value deviations\r\nmss <- sum((f - mean(f))^2)\r\n# sum of squared original-value deviations\r\ntss <- sum((y - mean(y))^2)\r\n# r-squared\r\nmss/tss                      \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6026682\r\n\r\n1. R-squared does not measure goodness of fit. It can be arbitrarily low when the model is completely correct. By making\\(σ^2\\) large, we drive R-squared towards 0, even when every assumption of the simple linear regression model is correct in every particular.\r\nWhat is \\(σ^2\\)? When we perform linear regression, we assume our model almost predicts our dependent variable. The difference between “almost” and “exact” is assumed to be a draw from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and some variance we call \\(σ^2\\).\r\nThis statement is easy enough to demonstrate. The way we do it here is to create a function that (1) generates data meeting the assumptions of simple linear regression (independent observations, normally distributed errors with constant variance), (2) fits a simple linear model to the data, and (3) reports the R-squared. Notice the only parameter for sake of simplicity is sigma. We then “apply” this function to a series of increasing \\(σ\\) values and plot the results.\r\n\r\n\r\nr2.0 <- function(sig){\r\n  # our predictor\r\n  x <- seq(1,10,length.out = 100)   \r\n  # our response; a function of x plus some random noise\r\n  y <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = sig) \r\n  # print the R-squared value\r\n  summary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared          \r\n}\r\nsigmas <- seq(0.5,20,length.out = 20)\r\n # apply our function to a series of sigma values\r\nrout <- sapply(sigmas, r2.0)            \r\nplot(rout ~ sigmas, type=\"b\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR-squared tanks hard with increasing sigma, even though the model is completely correct in every respect.\r\nR-squared can be arbitrarily close to 1 when the model is totally wrong.\r\nThe point being made is that R-squared does not measure goodness of fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(1)\r\n# our predictor is data from an exponential distribution\r\nx <- rexp(50,rate=0.005)\r\n# non-linear data generation\r\ny <- (x-1)^2 * runif(50, min=0.8, max=1.2) \r\n# clearly non-linear\r\nplot(x,y)             \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.8485146\r\n\r\nIt’s very high at about 0.85, but the model is completely wrong. Using R-squared to justify the “goodness” of our model in this instance would be a mistake. Hopefully one would plot the data first and recognize that a simple linear regression in this case would be inappropriate.\r\n3. R-squared says nothing about prediction error, even with \\(σ^2\\) exactly the same, and no change in the coefficients. R-squared can be anywhere between 0 and 1 just by changing the range of X. We’re better off using Mean Square Error (MSE) as a measure of prediction error.\r\nMSE is basically the fitted y values minus the observed y values, squared, then summed, and then divided by the number of observations.\r\nLet’s demonstrate this statement by first generating data that meets all simple linear regression assumptions and then regressing y on x to assess both R-squared and MSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- seq(1,10,length.out = 100)\r\nset.seed(1)\r\ny <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = 0.9)\r\nmod1 <- lm(y ~ x)\r\nsummary(mod1)$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.9383379\r\n\r\n# Mean squared error\r\nsum((fitted(mod1) - y)^2)/100\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6468052\r\n\r\nNow repeat the above code, but this time with a different range of x. Leave everything else the same:\r\n\r\n\r\n # new range of x\r\nx <- seq(1,2,length.out = 100)      \r\nset.seed(1)\r\ny <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = 0.9)\r\nmod1 <- lm(y ~ x)\r\nsummary(mod1)$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.1502448\r\n\r\n# Mean squared error\r\nsum((fitted(mod1) - y)^2)/100        \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6468052\r\n\r\nThe R-squared falls from 0.94 to 0.15 but the MSE remains the same. In other words the predictive ability is the same for both data sets, but the R-squared would lead you to believe the first example somehow had a model with more predictive power.\r\nR-squared can easily go down when the model assumptions are better fulfilled.\r\nLet’s examine this by generating data that would benefit from transformation. Notice the R code below is very much like our previous efforts but now we exponentiate our y variable.\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- seq(1,2,length.out = 100)\r\nset.seed(1)\r\ny <- exp(-2 - 0.09*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = 2.5))\r\nsummary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.003281718\r\n\r\nplot(lm(y ~ x), which=3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR-squared is very low and our residuals vs. fitted plot reveals outliers and non-constant variance. A common fix for this is to log transform the data. Let’s try that and see what happens:\r\n\r\n\r\nplot(lm(log(y)~x),which = 3) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic plot looks much better. Our assumption of constant variance appears to be met. But look at the R-squared:\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(lm(log(y)~x))$r.squared \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.0006921086\r\n\r\nIt’s even lower! This is an extreme case and it doesn’t always happen like this. In fact, a log transformation will usually produce an increase in R-squared. But as just demonstrated, assumptions that are better fulfilled don’t always lead to higher R-squared.\r\nIt is very common to say that R-squared is “the fraction of variance explained” by the regression. \\[Yet\\] if we regressed X on Y, we’d get exactly the same R-squared. This in itself should be enough to show that a high R-squared says nothing about explaining one variable by another.\r\nThis is the easiest statement to demonstrate:\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- seq(1,10,length.out = 100)\r\ny <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = 2)\r\nsummary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.737738\r\n\r\nsummary(lm(x ~ y))$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.737738\r\n\r\nDoes x explain y, or does y explain x? Are we saying “explain” to dance around the word “cause”? In a simple scenario with two variables such as this, R-squared is simply the square of the correlation between x and y:\r\n\r\n\r\nall.equal(cor(x,y)^2, summary(lm(x ~ y))$r.squared, summary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] TRUE\r\n\r\nLet’s recap:\r\nR-squared does not measure goodness of fit.\r\nR-squared does not measure predictive error.\r\nR-squared does not necessarily increase when assumptions are better satisfied.\r\nR-squared does not measure how one variable explains another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
