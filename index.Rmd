# About

I am orginally from Mantachie, MS and currently living in Covington, LA. I am a sales tax auditor for Sales Tax and More and work with all 50 states with reconciling companies sales tax data to become compliant with each state. I am a previous Mississippi State auditor for the Department of Revenue. I guess you can say I have found my niche.

I have two kids, work full time, and am currently a full time student in the Master's Accountacy program at MS State University.

My hobbies include traveling and spending time with family. I traveled to 23 countries by the time I turned 22.

I have two main goals to get to in my accounting career. 

1) Become a forensic accountant for the FBI

or

2) Get my software engineer certificate and help the accounting process. (This is a long shot!)
